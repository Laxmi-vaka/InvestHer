            "Financial Feminist: Overcome the Patriarchys Bullsh*t to Master Your Money and Build a Life You Love " By Tori Dunlap
          </a> - 
          In Financial Feminist, Tori Dunlap shares her mission to empower women 
          to take control of their finances and break through the barriers to financial freedom. 
          Growing up with money-savvy parents, Tori developed strong financial habits early, yet found 
          that many women never received this kind of education—often due to societal biases that 
          encourage boys to invest and pursue wealth, while girls are told to restrict spending. 
          Dunlap addresses these inequalities through Her First $100K and now through this book, which 
          blends practical financial advice with social critique, tackling everything from mindful 
          spending to investing for a comfortable retirement. With accessible strategies, judgment-free 
          guidance, and insightful prompts, Financial Feminist is a rallying call for women to reshape 
          their financial futures on their own terms.

          "Mrs Moneypenny's Financial Advice for Independent Women" By Mrs. Monneypunny
          </a> - Why do finances pose such a challenge for women, and how can we tackle it? 
          In Mrs Moneypenny's Careers Advice for Ambitious Women, Mrs Moneypenny underscores the need 
          for financial literacy and introduces the concept of a "financial finish line"—the amount needed 
          over a lifetime. Her follow-up guide, Mrs Moneypenny's Financial Advice For Independent Women, 
          offers practical steps to define and achieve this goal, from increasing income to saving for 
          retirement. With insights for both new learners and experienced professionals, this book empowers 
          women to take control of their financial futures.
